PROGRAMMING, CONTROL FLOW, AND SCRIPTING IN VBA
----------------------------------------------------------
Overview
----------------------------------------------------------

I was tasked with creating a script that loops through all the stocks of in a market for one year and outputs the following information:

1. The ticker symbol (AAB, AAF, AAR, Etc...)

2. Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

3. The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

4. The total stock volume of the stock. 

*ADDITIONALLY, I ADDED FUNCTIONALITY TO THE SCRIPT TO RETURN THE STOCK WITH THE "GREATEST % INCREASE", "GREATEST % DECREASE", AND "GREATEST TOTAL VOLUME"*
        
*ABLE TO RUN ON EVERY WORKSHEET (THAT IS, EVERY YEAR) AT ONCE*
